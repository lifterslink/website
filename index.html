        <h1>Welcome to Lifters Link; a platform made for and by powerlifters</h1>
        <p>We're building infrastructure as strong as the sport.</p>
        <p>Lifters Link is a comprehensive platform for the global powerlifting community where athletes, coaches, and meet directors can connect, spectate, showcase a history of their performance, and organize, register for, and execute meets.</p>
        <p>Like any good lift needing a warm up, we’re testing some ideas. Based on dozens of customer interviews, live meet notifications emerged as the most pressing concern. We’ve selected a few meets over the coming weeks to validate these findings.</p>
